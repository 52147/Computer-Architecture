eight great ideas in computer architecture

this 8 great ideas that computer architectures have been invented in the last 60 years of computer design:

1. Design for Moore's Law:
- the one constant for computer designers is  rapid change, which is driven largely by Moore's Law.
- as computer designs can take years, the resources available per chip can esaily double or qudruple between the start and finish of the project.
- computer architects must anticipate where the technology will be when the design finishes rather than design for where it starts.
- we use an "up and to the right" Moore's Las graph to represent designing for rapid change.

2. Use abstraction to simplify design:
- A major productivity technuque for hardware and software is to use abstractions to represne tht design at different levels of representation;
- lower-level details are hiddento offer a simpler model at higher levels.
3. Make the common case fast:
- making the common case fast will tend to enheance performance better than optimizing the rare case.
4. Performance via parallelism
- computer architects have offered designs that get more performance by performing operatins  in parallel.
5. Performance via pipelining
- memory need to b
6. Performance via Prediction
7.  Hierarchy of Memories
8. Dependability via redundancy


## 2.4 Signed and Unsigned Numbers

- First, let's review how a computer represents numbers.
- Humans are taught to think in base 10, but numbers may be represneted in any base.
  - for example, 123 base 10 = 1111011 base 2.

- Numbers are kept in computer hardware as a series of high and low electronic signals,
- and so they are considered base 2 numbers.
- (base 10 numbers are called decimal numbers , base 2 numbers are called binary numbers.)

- A single digit of a binary number is thus the "atom" of computing, since all information is composed of binary digits or bits.
- This fundamental building block can be one of 2 values,
- which can be thought of as several alternatives:
- high or low
- on or off
- true or false
- 1 or 0
