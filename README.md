eight great ideas in computer architecture

this 8 great ideas that computer architectures have been invented in the last 60 years of computer design:

1. Design for Moore's Law:
- the one constant for computer designers is  rapid change, which is driven largely by Moore's Law.
- as computer designs can take years, the resources available per chip can esaily double or qudruple between the start and finish of the project.
- computer architects must anticipate where the technology will be when the design finishes rather than design for where it starts.
- we use an "up and to the right" Moore's Las graph to represent designing for rapid change.

2. Use abstraction to simplify design:
- A major productivity technuque for hardware and software is to use abstractions to represne tht design at different levels of representation;
- lower-level details are hiddento offer a simpler model at higher levels.
3. Make the common case fast:
- making the common case fast will tend to enheance performance better than optimizing the rare case.
4. Performance via parallelism
- computer architects have offered designs that get more performance by performing operatins  in parallel.
5. Performance via pipelining
- memory need to b
6. Hierarchy of Memories
7. Dependability via redundancy
