eight great ideas in computer architecture

this 8 great ideas that computer architectures have been invented in the last 60 years of computer design:

1. Design for Moore's Law:
- the one constant for computer designers is  rapid change, which is driven largely by Moore's Law.
- as computer designs can take years, the resources available per chip can esaily double or qudruple between the start and finish of the project.
- computer architects must anticipate where the technology will be when the design finishes rather than design for where it starts.
- we use an "up and to the right" Moore's Las graph to represent designing for rapid change.

2. Use abstraction to simplify design:
- A major productivity technuque for hardware and software is to use abstractions to represne tht design at different levels of representation;
- lower-level details are hiddento offer a simpler model at higher levels.
3. Make the common case fast:
- making the common case fast will tend to enheance performance better than optimizing the rare case.
4. Performance via parallelism
- computer architects have offered designs that get more performance by performing operatins  in parallel.
5. Performance via pipelining
- memory need to b
6. Performance via Prediction
7.  Hierarchy of Memories
8. Dependability via redundancy


## 2.4 Signed and Unsigned Numbers

- First, let's review how a computer represents numbers.
- Humans are taught to think in base 10, but numbers may be represneted in any base.
  - for example, 123 base 10 = 1111011 base 2.

- Numbers are kept in computer hardware as a series of high and low electronic signals,
- and so they are considered base 2 numbers.
- (base 10 numbers are called decimal numbers , base 2 numbers are called binary numbers.)

- A single digit of a binary number is thus the "atom" of computing, since all information is composed of binary digits or bits.
- This fundamental building block can be one of 2 values,
- which can be thought of as several alternatives:
 - high or low
 - on or off
 - true or false
 - 1 or 0

- Generalizing the point, in any number base, the value of ith digit d is 
  - d x Base i
  - where i starts at 0 and increases from right to left.
  - THis representatin leads to an obvious way to number the bits in the word:
    - simply use the power of the base for that bit.
    - we subscript decimal numbers with ten and binary numbers with two
    - for example 
      - 1011two
      - represents:
      - (1x2^3) + (0x2^2) + (1x2^1) + (1x2^0)ten
      -  = 8 + 0 +2 +1
      -  = 11
 
 - we nuber the bits 0,1,2,3,4,5...31(32 bits wide) from right to left in a word.
 - The drawing below shows the numbering of bits with a MIPS word and the placement of the number 1011 two: 

- Since words are drawn vertically as well as horizontally, 
- leftmost and rightmost may be unclear.
  - Hence, the pharse least significant bit is used to refer to the right most bit (bit 0 above)
  - and most significant bit to the leftmost bit (bit 31).

- The MIPS word is 32 bits long, so we can represent 2^32 different 32-bit patterns.
- it is natural to let these combination represent the numbers from 0 to 2^32-1 (4,294,967,295 ten):


- That is, 32-bit binary numbers can be represented in terms of the bit value times a power of 2
- (here xi means the ith bit of x):
   - (x31 x 2^31) + (x30 x 2^30) + (x29 x 2^29) + ... + (x1 x 2^1) + (x0 x 2^0)
   - for reasons we will shortly see,
   - these positive numbers are called unsigned numbers. 

## 2.5 Representing instructions in the computer

## chapter 4 processor
- MIPS(microprocessor without interlocked pipelined statges) architecture:
  - is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA)
  - developed by MIPS computer systems
- Instruction set architecture (ISA):
  - is the interface between the computer's software and hardware and also can be viewed as the progtammer's view of the machine.
  - computers do not understand high-level progtamming languages such as java, c++.
  - A processor only understand instructions encoded in some numerical fashion, usually as binary numbers.
  - compliers translate those hight level languages into instruction that the processor can understand.
  
  - Beside instructions, the ISA defines items in the computer that are available to a program
  -  --e.g., data types, registers, addressing modes, and memory.
   - instructions locate these available items with register indexes( or names) and memory addressing modes.
   
  - The ISA of a computer is usually described in a small instruction manual,
  -  which describes how the instructions are encoded.
  -  Also, it may define short(vaguely) mnemonic names for the instructions.
  -  The name can be recongnized by a software development called an assembler/
     - assembler:
     - is a computer program that translates a human-readable software programs to isolate and correct malfunction in binary computer programs.  


- ISAs vary in quality and completeness.
- A good ISA compromises between programmer convenience(how easy the code is to understand)
- , size of the code(how much code is required to do a specific action),
- cost of the computer to interpret the instructions(more complexity means more hardware needed to decode and execute the instructions),
- and speed of the computer(with nore complex decoding hardware comes loger decode time).
